Some codes are already available at the original research [repo](https://github.com/yongxuUSTC/aDAE_DNN_audio_tagging). However, some codes are missing there to reproduce the full experiemts. Also, the information about the challenge context and the baseline methods are available at this [repo](https://github.com/pafoster/dcase2016_task4).
